## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) spec:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

* **type**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`
* **scope**: A noun describing a section of the codebase (e.g., `api`, `config`, `middleware`).
* **description**: A short imperative statement of the change.

## Code Style Guidelines

* **TypeScript**: Use strict typing. Avoid `any` whenever possible.
* **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` before submitting. We use **ESLint** with the Next.js and Prettier integrations.
* **Formatting**: Use **Prettier** for code formatting. Run `npm run format` to auto-format.
* **Imports**: Group imports in the following order, separated by a blank line:

  1. Node.js built-ins
  2. External packages
  3. Absolute imports (e.g., `@/components`)
  4. Relative imports
* **CSS**: Tailwind classes only; avoid custom CSS unless necessary. Keep utility classes in logical order.
* **Testing**: Write unit tests for new features or bug fixes. Run `npm run test` to ensure all tests pass.
