  # If you still want to route traffic for other hosts or paths, you would add them here.
  # For example, if you had previous rules that are now being consolidated under this host,
  # you would remove them. If you have other hosts, you'd add them as separate entries
  # in the `rules` list, or in a separate `tls` entry if they also need HTTPS.
