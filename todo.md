## UI
    - [x] `/images` page that show all the uploaded images by a user
    - [x] get out of this protected route and crate a upload route or something better.
     > Note:  keeping the upload in the `/protected` route 

## Core
    - [ ] Implement this in supabase functions and Vercel edge functions
    - [ ] add image to `output-image` bucket and delete it only after 3-4 days
    - [ ] cache the image in the browser for 3-4 days
